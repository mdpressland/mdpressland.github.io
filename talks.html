15.11.2023:
<i>Triangulations versus cluster-tilting in infinity-gons</i> (Algebra and Geometry Seminar, Graz)
<p class="talk_description">
The combinatorics of triangulations of a disc with marked points on its boundary is surprisingly rich: for example, when the number of marked points is finite, the triangulations form an associahedra, and are closely related to the representation theory of type \(\mathsf{A}_n\) quivers. Understanding this combinatorics has applications in, for example, Teichmüller theory, in which a triangulation determines a coordinate system of lambda-lengths on a decorated Teichmüller space, and one may be interested in the coordinate transformations relating these for different choices of triangulation.</br>
One way of understanding these structures is to use triangulated categories. The appropriate categorical model has been defined by Caldero–Chapoton–Schiffler when the set of marked points is finite, and by Igusa–Todorov when the set is discrete with finitely many accumulation points, all two-sided. In these models, crossings of arcs are encoded by extensions in the category, and hence triangulations by maximal rigid (or weak cluster-tilting) subcategories. Recently, Paquette–Yıldırım have given a model when the accumulation points are themselves marked, violating discreteness. While their model still has indecomposable objects in bijection with arcs, crossings are no longer encoded by extensions, and so the connection to the combinatorics of triangulations appears to be lost. In joint work with İlke Çanakçı and Martin Kalck, we recover this connection by passing to an extriangulated substructure on Paquette–Yıldırım’s category, in which weak cluster-tilting subcategories are once again in bijection with triangulations. While many general results from cluster theory do not apply directly, since this extriangulated category is not Frobenius, we are able to re-prove many of their conclusions using the relationship to triangulations of the disc, or to its decorated Teichmüller space, as in work of Çanakçı–Felikson.

<h3>2023</h3>

12.10.2023:
<i>Double Bruhat cells and generalizations</i> (<a href="https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2341/www_view">Arbeitsgemeinschaft: Cluster Algebras</a>, Oberwolfach)
<p class="talk_description">
I will describe (\(\mathcal{A}\)-side, or \(\mathrm{K}_2\)) cluster algebra structures on double Bruhat cells, due to Berenstein, Fomin and Zelevinsky, and on double Bott–Samelson cells, due to to Shen and Weng, focussing on \(\mathrm{SL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})\). These families include interesting varieties such as base affine space, and are included in the larger set of braid varieties, which carry cluster algebra structures in general.
</p>

06.10.2023:
<i>Cluster structures on cells in flag varieties</i> (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/erngglasgow/wee-math-seminar">E‐RNG Wee Math Seminar</a>, Glasgow / Glaschu)
<p class="talk_description">
I will give a quick introduction to the combinatorics of linear algebraic groups and flag varieties, focussing on \(\mathrm{SL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})\) (i.e. type \(\mathsf{A}_{n}\)), including the definition of Bruhat cells and their generalisations. I will then describe (\(\mathcal{A}\)-side, or \(\mathrm{K}_2\)) cluster algebra structures on double Bruhat cells, due to Berenstein, Fomin and Zelevinsky, and on double Bott–Samelson cells, due to to Shen and Weng, continuing to focus on \(\mathrm{SL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})\). These families include interesting varieties such as base affine space, and are included in the larger set of braid varieties, which carry cluster algebra structures in general.

04.10.2023:
<i>Positroid varieties via representation theory</i> (<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/?seriesID=4">Algebra and Number Theory Seminar</a>, Glasgow / Glaschu)
<p class="talk_description">
Total positivity is by now a classical subject in linear algebra, having begun in earnest with the work of Gantmacher and Krein from 1937. Recent results of Postnikov and others have emphasised the importance of positivity in flag varieties, particularly the Grassmannian. A key tool in this area is Postnikov’s positroid stratification of the Grassmannian, and the cluster algebra structures on its various (open) cells, recently confirmed to exist by Galashin and Lam.</br>
In this talk, I will explain this story in the language of representation theory, with the positroid varieties and their cluster algebra structures being encoded by the representation theory of various non-commutative orders over the power series ring in one variable. Except for the top-dimensional stratum, Galashin and Lam’s construction produces two different cluster algebra structures on each open positroid, and an application of this representation-theoretic approach is a proof that these two structures quasi-coincide, as conjectured by Muller and Speyer in 2017. In particular, this means that these structures are equivalent from the point of view of total positivity.

14.09.2023:
<i>Quasi-coincidence of positroid cluster structures via derived categories</i> (<a href="http://www.birs.ca/events/2023/5-day-workshops/23w5047">Silting in Representation Theory, Singularities, and Noncommutative Geometry</a>, Oaxaca) [<a href="http://www.birs.ca/events/2023/5-day-workshops/23w5047/videos/watch/202309141130-Pressland.html">video</a>]
<p class="talk_description">
A long-standing expectation in the study of total positivity, recently confirmed by Galashin and Lam, is that the cells in the positroid stratification of the Grassmannian have cluster algebra structures. The eventual construction actually provides two different such structures, but a conjecture by Muller and Speyer asserts that they should have a close relationship known as quasi-coincidence. In this talk, I will outline a proof of the conjecture. Despite the statement being about combinatorial geometry, the proof works by translating it into the language of representation theory, and then applying techniques from homological algebra: ultimately, the quasi-coincidence of the cluster structures follows from a statement about the derived category of a certain non-commutative Gorenstein ring.
</p>

18.08.2023:
<i>What is… an extriangulated category?</i> (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/erngglasgow/wee-math-seminar">E‐RNG Wee Math Seminar</a>, Glasgow / Glaschu)
<p class="talk_description">
I will motivate and explain Nakaoka and Palu’s definition of extriangulated categories, a common generalisation of exact and triangulated categories. I will then briefly discuss the class of \(0\)-Auslander extriangulated categories, as defined by Gorsky, Nakaoka and Palu, and explain what these categories have to do with \(2\)-term complexes of projectives.
</p>

13.07.2023: <i>Positroid cluster structures via derived categories</i> (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/samosconferencerep/home">Homological Algebra and Representation Theory</a>, Καρλόβασι)

04.07.2023: <i>Homotopy arrow categories for finite-dimensional algebras</i> (<a href="https://ncm29.math.aau.dk/">Nordic Congress of Mathematicians</a>, Aalborg) [<a href="slides/aalborg23.pdf">slides</a>]
<p class="talk_description">
The homotopy arrow category of projectives for a finite-dimensional algebra \(A\) has as objects the morphisms between projective \(A\)-modules, and as morphisms commutative squares up to homotopy. This category has natural realisations as a full extension-closed subcategory of the triangulated category of perfect complexes of \(A\)-modules, and hence carries a canonical extriangulated structure. Indeed, it is one of the most important motivating examples of an extriangulated category.</br>
In this talk I will describe various categorical equivalences involving the homotopy arrow category, in the context of both gentle algebras, and of cluster-tilted algebras (and their generalisations). This is joint work with Xin Fang, Mikhail Gorsky, Yann Palu and Pierre-Guy Plamondon.

10–12.05.2023: <i>Positroid varieties: combinatorics, clusters and categorification</i> (<a href="http://portal.math.ipm.ir/PagesEvents/DisEventsHome.aspx?esbu=6c2d88d9-a0e4-4502-bbcc-21004b56e4b4">Mutations in Representation Theory of Algebras</a>, Online / <span style=’font-family:"Noto+Sans+Arabic"’>اصفهان</span>)
<p class="talk_description">
The Grassmannian, the moduli space of \(k\)-dimensional subspaces of an \(n\)-dimensional vector space, has certain subvarieties called open positroid varieties, with many interesting properties from the perspective of both Lie theory and total positivity. A recent theorem by Galashin and Lam (building on earlier partial results of Serhiyenko–Sherman-Bennett–Williams, Scott and Fomin–Zelevinsky) shows that the coordinate ring of each open positroid variety may be equipped with the structure of a cluster algebra in two ways, which are typically different, in the sense that different functions become cluster variables. Under an additional connectedness assumption, these cluster algebras admit Frobenius exact categorifications (by work of myself with Çanakçı and King, building on Jensen–King–Su and Baur–King–Marsh).</br>
In this series of talks, I will explain what positroid varieties are, how their cluster algebra structures arise, and how to categorify these structures. At the end, I will show how to use the categorifications to make progress towards the proof of a conjecture by Muller and Speyer from 2017.
</p>

28.03.2023: <i>Quasi-coincidence of cluster structures on positroid varieties</i> (<a href="https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/combrep">Combinatorial Aspects of Representation Theory</a>, Oslo)
<p class="talk_description">
Positroid varieties are subvarieties of the Grassmannian that appear in the context of Postnikov’s approach to total positivity. For this reason and others, it was long expected that their coordinate rings should carry a cluster algebra structure, and this expectation was finally confirmed by Galashin and Lam in 2019. In fact, Galashin and Lam provide two cluster algebra structures (for the price of one!) and while they are abstractly isomorphic, they are not equal, in the sense that the cluster variables are different sets of functions on the positroid variety in each case. A conjecture by Muller and Speyer from 2016 asserts a precise relationship between these two cluster structures, namely that they should quasi-coincide. This would imply in particular that the two sets of cluster monomials are in fact equal.<br/>
In this talk, I will outline a proof of the conjecture in the generic case that the positroid is connected. Perhaps surprisingly, the proof works by using categorification to translate the problem into homological algebra. Precisely, it uses the categorification of the cluster algebras by myself, that of perfect matchings and various other combinatorial ingredients from my joint work with Çanakçı and King, and that of quasi-cluster morphisms by Fraser and Keller.
</p>

14.03.2023: <i>Quasi-coïncidence des structures amassées sur des variétés de positroïde</i> (<a href="https://lmv.math.cnrs.fr/evenements/categorie/seminaire-ag/">Séminaire AG</a>, Versailles)
<p class="talk_description">
Les variétés de positroïde sont des sous-variétés de la grassmannienne qui apparaissent dans l’approche de Postnikov de la positivité totale. Pour cette raison et d’autres, on s’attendait depuis longtemps à ce que leurs anneaux de coordonnées portent une structure d’algèbre amassée, et cette attente a finalement été confirmée par Galashin et Lam en 2019. En fait, Galashin et Lam fournissent deux structures d’algèbre amassée (pour le prix d’une&nbsp;!) et bien qu’elles sont abstraitement isomorphes, elles ne sont pas égales, dans le sens où les variables amassées sont différents ensembles de fonctions sur la variété de positroïde dans chaque cas. Une conjecture de Muller et Speyer de 2017 affirme une relation précise entre ces deux structures amassées, à savoir qu’elles devraient quasi-coïncider. Cela impliquerait en particulier que les deux ensembles de monômes amassés sont en fait égaux.<br/>
Dans cet exposé, je présenterai (en anglais) une preuve de cette conjecture dans le cas générique où le positroïde est connecté. De façon peut-être surprenante, la preuve utilise la catégorification pour traduire le problème combinatoire en algèbre homologique. Plus précisément, elle utilise la catégorification des algèbres amassées par moi-même, celle des correspondances parfaites et divers autres ingrédients combinatoires de mon travail conjoint avec Çanakçı et King, et celle des morphismes quasi-amassés par Fraser et Keller.

<h3>2022</h3>

09.12.2022: <i>Calabi–Yau algebras from consistent dimer models</i> (<a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~jmartens/GLEN.html">GLEN Algebraic Geometry Seminar</a>, Edinburgh / Dùn Èideann)
<p class="talk_description">
A dimer model is a bipartite graph drawn in a topological surface, which determines a typically non‐commutative algebra. Under certain combinatorial consistency conditions, this algebra turns out to be Calabi–Yau, either on the nose or in a relative sense when the surface has boundary. I will explain this result, focussing on dimer models on the torus and on the disk. I will then describe some applications, which turn out to be quite different in the two cases: dimer models on the torus have applications in algebraic geometry, yielding resolutions of singularities of Gorenstein toric \(3\)‐folds, whereas those on the disk lead to categorifications of cluster algebra structures on certain Lie‐theoretic varieties.
</p>

02.11.2022: <i>What is the Temperley–Lieb category?</i> (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/glasgowalgebrapreseminar/home">Algebra Pre‐Seminar</a>, Glasgow / Glaschu)
<p class="talk_description">
I will describe the Temperley–Lieb category, as a monoidal category, in terms of a diagram calculus. Beginning with some preliminaries on monoidal categories, I will then define the Temperley–Lieb algebra, and finally the Temperley–Lieb category. Time‐permitting, I will sketch the relationship between the Temperley–Lieb algebra and the Jones polynomial, a link invariant in knot theory.
</p>

12.10.2022:
<i>g‐vectors in representation theory</i> (<a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/research/seminars/">Pure Maths Seminar</a>, Lancaster)
<p class="talk_description">
The goal of this talk is to give a flavour of how representation theory can be applied to the recent theory of cluster algebras, introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky. These are primarily combinatorial objects, with a great deal of complicated structure, which in the original definition must be computed recursively from some small amount of initial data. Using the cluster‐theoretic notion of g‐vectors as an example, I will demonstrate how homological methods from representation theory can be used to circumvent this recursive process, resulting in more direct computations.
</p>

26.08.2022:
<i>Stability, scattering and (co)silting</i> (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/erngglasgow/wee-math-seminar">E‐RNG Wee Math Seminar</a>, Glasgow / Glaschu)
<p class="talk_description">
In this talk I will summarise, mainly through examples, part of the relationship between stability conditions (both King and Bridgeland flavoured), scattering diagrams (Kontsevich–Soibelman and Gross–Siebert), and cosilting mutation (Angeleri Hügel–Laking–Šťovíček–Vitória). The presentation is based on lecture series at ICRA 2022 by Anna Barbieri, Rosanna Laking and Hipólito Treffinger.
</p>

09.08.2022:
<i>On categorification of g‐vectors</i> (<a href="https://icra2022.cmat.edu.uy/">ICRA 2022</a>, Buenos Aires) [<a href="slides/icra22.pdf">slides</a>]
<p class="talk_description">
First arising in a combinatorial form in Fomin and Zelevinsky’s theory of cluster algebras, g‐vectors have two closely related representation‐theoretic incarnations. The first of these is the notion of an index (or coindex) in a \(2\)‐Calabi–Yau triangulated category, whereas the second involves projective presentations of modules over finite‐dimensional algebras. In this talk I will explain some joint work in progress with Xin Fang, Mikhail Gorsky, Yann Palu and Pierre‐Guy Plamondon, in which we show how to lift the relationship between these two computations to an equivalence of categories. The categories in question will be extriangulated, and part of the talk will serve as an introduction to such categories, via well‐behaved examples. I will also explain how our results extend beyond the triangulated setting, to indices in more general stably \(2\)‐Calabi–Yau categories.
</p>

21.07.2022:
<i>Categorification of positroids</i> (<a href="https://conferences.au.dk/homologicalalgebra2022">Geometric and Combinatorial Methods in Homological Algebra</a>, Aarhus)
<p class="talk_description">
Postnikov diagrams are combinatorial objects consisting of strands drawn in a disc, and encode initial seeds for cluster algebra structures on the coordinate ring of the Grassmannian and more general positroid varieties. In particular, such a diagram can be used to compute a cluster of Plücker coordinates, together with its exchange quiver, which then generates the relevant coordinate ring as a cluster algebra. In this talk I will explain joint work with İlke Çanakçı and Alastair King, in which we show that this combinatorial computation is in fact algebraically natural, from the point of view of Jensen, King and Su’s Grassmannian cluster category and the representation theory of a pair of algebras attached to the Postnikov diagram.
</p>

10.06.2022:
<i>Frieze patterns and derived categories</i> (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/erngglasgow/wee-math-seminar">E‐RNG Wee Math Seminar</a>, Glasgow / Glaschu)
<p class="talk_description">
I will give a quick tour of some topics related to frieze patterns, with a particular focus on links to the derived category of a Dynkin quiver (and to quotients of this, such as the cluster category).
</p>

06.06.2022:
<i>Categorification for positroid varieties</i> (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/clusters-braids-seminar/">Clusters and Braids Seminar</a>, Online)
<p class="talk_description">
Coordinate rings of open positroid varieties in the Grassmannian carry a rich and complex combinatorial structure arising from Postnikov diagrams (also known as alternating strand diagrams, or dimer models in the disk). A recent result in this area by Galashin and Lam, confirms the conjecture that these coordinate rings are isomorphic to cluster algebras. In this talk, I will explain how these cluster algebras can be (additively) categorised, allowing for an interpretation of much of the combinatorics of Postnikov diagrams in terms of representation theory. In particular, I will explain how face labels for Postnikov diagrams (which determine clusters of Plücker coordinates) may be understood as names of modules over an appropriate algebra. Time permitting, I will also explain how the twist automorphism (or Donaldson–Thomas transformation) corresponds to the syzygy functor on the categorification. This is based on joint work with İlke Çanakçı and Alastair King.
</p>

04.06.2022:

Part of the talk will serve as a brief introduction to well‐behaved classes of extriangulated categories and their relationship to relative homological algebra as developed by Auslander and Solberg.
</p>

08.04.2022:
<i>Tilting: derived equivalences and mutation</i> (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/erngglasgow/wee-math-seminar">E‐RNG Wee Math Seminar</a>, Glasgow / Glaschu)
<p class="talk_description">
I will explain the relationship between tilting modules (and complexes) and derived equivalences, focussing on the case of finite‐dimensional algebras. I will then discuss two approaches to completing the class of (classical) tilting objects with respect to mutation, namely \(\tau\)‐tilting and cluster‐tilting.
</p>

31.03.2022:
<i>Dual dimers</i> (Working Group, Glasgow / Glaschu)
<p class="talk_description">
I will describe Bocklandt’s construction of dual dimer models, and related equivalences of (\(A_\infty\)‐)categories, primarily through examples.
</p>

17.03.2022:
<i>Categorification of positroids</i> (<a href="https://kierancalvert.com/artin-manchester-2022/?fbclid=IwAR1eKi2AXgFqFbdS50RT5cQREoJ2gqmQashvg1Q7Ajr04Adkpv3_xRvrrWI">58th ARTIN Meeting</a>, Manchester)
<p class="talk_description">
The coordinate ring of the Grassmannian has a very rich combinatorial structure arising from Postnikov diagrams (also known as alternating strand diagrams, plabic graphs, or dimer models in the disk). In particular, the choice of such a diagram determines a positroid, a corresponding subvariety of the Grassmannian, and a cluster algebra structure on the coordinate ring of that variety. In this talk, I will explain how these combinatorial constructions may be interpreted in terms of representations of quivers (i.e. categorified). This is joint work with İlke Çanakçı and Alastair King.
</p>

02–04.03.2022:
<i>Dimer models: consistency, Calabi–Yau properties and categorification</i> (<a href="https://haruhisa-enomoto.github.io/ppacya/">Preprojective Algebras and Calabi–Yau Algebras</a>, Online / <span style=’font-family:"Noto Sans JP"’>大阪</span>)
<p class="talk_description">
A dimer model is a bipartite graph drawn in a surface. First introduced in the context of statistical mechanics, dimer models became a significant topic in string theory around fifteen years ago. In mathematics, a key development at this time was the study of consistency conditions, and the use of dimer models on the torus to construct non‐commutative crepant resolutions of \(3\)‐dimensional Gorenstein singularities. A key property of a consistent dimer model is that its associated non‐commutative dimer algebra is \(3\)‐Calabi–Yau. More recently, dimer models have reappeared, now on surfaces with boundary and sometimes called plabic graphs or Postnikov diagrams, in the context of categorifying cluster algebras with coefficients, notably the cluster structure on the Grassmannian and its positroid strata. In this lecture series, I will survey these ideas.

<i>Grassmannian twists categorified</i> (<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/?seriesID=4">Algebra and Number Theory Seminar</a>, Glasgow / Glaschu)
<p class="talk_description">
The Grassmannian of \(k\)‐dimensional subspaces of an \(n\)‐dimensional space carries a birational automorphism called the twist (or sometimes the Donaldson–Thomas transformation), defined by Berenstein–Fomin–Zelevinsky and Marsh–Scott. This automorphism respects the cluster algebra structure on the coordinate ring, being a quasi‐cluster automorphism in the sense of Fraser. By work of Muller–Speyer, similar results hold for positroid strata in the Grassmannian.</br>
The cluster algebras in this picture have been categorified, by Jensen–King–Su in the case of the full Grassmannian, and by myself for more general (connected) positroid varieties. In this talk I will report on joint work with İlke Çanakçı and Alastair King, in which we describe the twist in terms of these categorifications. The key ingredient is provided by perfect matching modules, certain combinatorially defined representations for a quiver ‘with faces’, and I will also explain this construction.

This automorphism respects the cluster algebra structure on the coordinate ring, being a quasi‐cluster automorphism in the sense of Fraser. By work of Muller–Speyer, similar results hold for positroid strata in the Grassmannian.</br>
The cluster algebras in this picture have been categorified, by Jensen–King–Su in the case of the full Grassmannian, and by myself for more general (connected) positroid varieties. In this talk I will report on joint work with İlke Çanakçı and Alastair King, in which we describe the twist in terms of these categorifications. The key ingredient is provided by perfect matching modules, certain combinatorially defined representations for a quiver ‘with faces’, and I will also explain this construction.

<p class="talk_description">
The Grassmannian and its totally positive part have a very rich combinatorial structure, studied by many people. In particular, Postnikov has shown how the totally positive Grassmannian is stratified by positroid varieties. Recent work of Galashin and Lam shows that the coordinate ring of each (open) positroid stratum is a cluster algebra, with this structure determined by a combinatorial object called a Postnikov diagram. In this talk I will explain how the same diagram also gives rise to representation theoretic objects which can be used to (additively) categorify this cluster algebra. This is partly joint work with İlke Çanakçı and Alastair King.

In this talk I will report on joint work with Jan E.

The category of Gorenstein projective modules for a finite‐dimensional Gorenstein algebra has almost split sequences, and hence an Auslander–Reiten translation. Consequently, a Gorenstein projective module has two Auslander–Reiten translates, one in the subcategory of Gorenstein projectives, and one in the whole module category. In joint work with Sondre Kvamme, we relate these two translates, and in so doing shed new light on results of García Elsener and Schiffler on Calabi–Yau tilted algebras.

In this series of three talks, we will sketch an introduction to the theory of cluster algebras and cluster categories for acyclic quivers, motivated by Conway and Coxeter’s combinatorial results concerning frieze patterns. The goal is to show how these more abstract theories provide a conceptual explanation for phenomena concerning friezes, principally integrality and periodicity. To this end, in the first talk we will introduce frieze patterns and their combinatorial properties, and explain Conway and Coxeter’s classification in terms of triangulated polygons. The second talk will introduce Fomin–Zelevinsky’s cluster algebras, and show how integrality of friezes follows from the Laurent phenomenon from cluster variables. In the third talk, we define cluster categories of acyclic quivers, following Buan, Marsh, Reineke, Reiten and Todorov, and explain their relationship to cluster algebras, leading to an explanation for periodicity of friezes.

Many rings of interest in geometry can be equipped with the additional combinatorial structure of a cluster algebra, which one would like to understand representation‐theoretically by means of a cluster category.

In this talk I will explain how to reverse this logic, and use Postnikov diagrams to produce cluster categories.

When \(Q\) is acyclic, both Noetherianity of \(B\) and this equivalence hold. The construction appears to be related to the Ginzburg dg‐algebra of \((Q,W)\), and I will discuss these similarities.

In this talk I will explain how, at least in certain cases, one can use this algebraic description to construct a desingularisation of \(X\). The construction is representation‐theoretic, involving a tilt of an endomorphism algebra in \(\operatorname{mod}(A)\), and the desingularising variety is again described in terms of quiver Grassmannians.

<i>Dimer models and cluster categorification</i> (<a href="http://www.iaz.uni-stuttgart.de/oberseminar-algebra.t">Oberseminar am Institut für Algebra und Zahlentheorie</a>, Stuttgart)
<p class="talk_description">
The cluster algebra structure on the homogeneous coordinate ring of a Grassmannian has been categorified by Jensen–King–Su. The interplay between the combinatorics and the representation theory can be studied via dimer models, or equivalently Postnikov diagrams, which are also fundamental to other structures on the Grassmannian, such as its positive part and matroid stratification. By comparing two formulae for computing cluster monomials, one representation theoretic (the Fu–Keller cluster character) and one combinatorial (the Marsh–Scott dimer partition function), I will explain some of these interactions. In particular, I will explain the relationship between perfect matchings on the dimer model and certain modules for its ‘cluster‐tilted’ algebra. This is joint work with İlke Çanakçı and Alastair King.

<i>Functors and morphisms determined by subcategories</i> (Working Group on Auslander’s Philadelphia Notes, Stuttgart)
<p class="talk_description">
Following exposition by Krause, I will explain some aspects of the theory of morphisms determined by modules from a more functorial perspective. The main result will be a characterisation of those morphisms in the (large) module category of an arbitrary ring which are (right) determined by a subcategory of the finitely presented modules.

I will describe constructions of \(2\)‐Calabi–Yau triangulated categories and stably \(2\)‐Calabi–Yau Frobenius categories. In particular, I will demonstrate how Amiot’s \(2\)‐Calabi–Yau triangulated cluster category, usually defined via dg‐algebras, may be realised as the stable category of the Frobenius category of Gorenstein projective modules over an ordinary algebra. One consequence of this approach is the construction of a categorification of the (polarised) principal coefficient cluster algebra associated to any acyclic quiver.

In this talk I will introudce the lattice of right‐equivalence classes of morphisms ending in a fixed object, and show that it is indeed a lattice. I will also introduce the ‘sublattices’ (strictly sub‐meet‐semilattices) of morphisms determined by a module. The second goal of the talk is to give a proof of the first main result of the seminar, namely that every morphism in the module category of an Artin algebra is right‐determined by some module, so that these smaller lattices in fact cover the larger lattice.

<i>From dimer models to cluster variables: the Marsh–Scott formula revisited</i> (<a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/gjasso/workshops/camp/">Cluster Algebras in Mathematical Physics</a>, Mainz)
<p class="talk_description">
A key example of a geometric cluster algebra is Scott’s cluster structure on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian. As was implicit in Scott’s original work, and made explicit by Baur–King–Marsh, this cluster algebra is intimately related to the combinatorics of dimer models on discs. Marsh and Scott have given a formula for computing certain cluster monomials (the twisted Plücker coordinates) in terms of these dimer models. These monomials may also be computed by Fu–Keller’s cluster character on the Grassmannian cluster category introduced by Jensen–King–Su. In joint work with İlke Çanakçı and Alastair King, we compare these formulae, yielding representation theoretic interpretations for aspects of the dimer combinatorics.

<i>Perfect matchings and the Grassmannian cluster algebra</i> (<a href="http://imsc.uni-graz.at/AlgNTh/Timetable.html">Algebra and Number Theory Seminar</a>, Graz)
<p class="talk_description">
A key example of a geometric cluster algebra is Scott’s cluster structure on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian. This cluster algebra admits a categorification, due to Jensen, King and Su, and it has been shown by Baur, King and Marsh that the endomorphism algebras of some special objects in this category may be described combinatorially in terms of bipartite graphs on a disc, called dimer models. Marsh and Scott give a formula computing some of the cluster monomials (the twisted Plücker coordinates) combinatorially from these dimer models. These cluster monomials may also be computed using the cluster character formula, provided in this level of generality by Fu and Keller. Understanding how these two apparently different computations arrive at the same answer reveals further connections between dimer models and homological algebra in the Grassmannian cluster category. This is joint work with İlke Çanakçı and Alastair King.

<i>Dominant dimension and canonical tilts</i> (<a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/birep/seminar.php">BIREP Seminar</a>, Bielefeld)
<p class="talk_description">
Any finite dimensional algebra with dominant dimension \(d\) admits a ‘canonical’ \(k\)‐tilting module for each \(k\) from \(0\) to \(d\), each giving a derived equivalence with some algebra \(B_k\). These tilts have very special properties; for example, they never increase the global dimension. In the case of the Auslander algebra of a representation‐finite algebra \(A\), Crawley‐Boevey and Sauter (generalising Cerulli Irelli, Feigin and Reineke) used the tilt \(B_1\) to construct desingularisations of certain varieties of \(A\)‐modules. More generally, for \(d\) at least \(2\), any algebra of dominant dimension \(d\) is the endomorphism algebra of a generating‐cogenerating module \(M\) over some algebra \(A\), and many of the results for Auslander algebras have analogues in this setting. In particular, we may realise each \(B_k\) as an endomorphism algebra in the homotopy category of \(A\), an observation which we can exploit to describe rank varieties, of arbitrary finite dimensional modules over arbitrary finite dimensional algebras, as affine quotient varieties. We may also use the canonical tilting modules to give a new characterisation of \(d\)‐Auslander (or, more generally, \(d\)‐Auslander–Gorenstein) algebras. This is joint work with Julia Sauter.

<i>Graded Frobenius cluster categories</i> (<a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~conf/ltca16/">Workshop on Cluster Algebras and Lie Theory</a>, Roma) [<a href="slides/rome16.pdf">slides</a>]
<p class="talk_description">
A grading of a cluster algebra is a grading of the underlying algebra such that all cluster variables are homogeneous elements. In practice, to specify a grading it is enough to give local information, by assigning degrees to the cluster variables of a single cluster in such a way that the exchange relations of that cluster are homogeneous. For cluster algebras categorified by Frobenius categories, we reinterpret gradings categorically, both globally, as functions on the Grothendieck group, and locally, as dimension vectors for endomorphism algebras of cluster‐tilting objects. This is joint work with Jan Grabowski.

I will define what it means for an algebra to be internally Calabi–Yau with respect to an idempotent.  This generalises the definition of a Calabi–Yau algebra by allowing the required Ext‐group symmetries for modules to have a ‘restricted support’. I will explain how internally Calabi–Yau
algebras are related to cluster‐tilting objects in certain stably Calabi–Yau Frobenius categories,
thus providing a link to the categorification programme for cluster algebras with frozen variables.

Let \(A\) be a Koszul algebra with semi‐simple degree zero part \(k\) and let \(A^!=\operatorname{Ext}^\bullet_A(k,k)^{\mathrm{op}}\) be its Koszul dual. Then modules over \(A\) are related to modules over \(A^!\) via a pair of adjoint functors at the level of homotopy categories of chain complexes. Some explicit computations show that these adjoint functors do not in general descend to equivalences of the derived categories, but do induce equivalences of other, related categories (cf. the Berenstein–Gelʼfand–Gelʼfand correspondence). I will describe the induced equivalences of Fløystad, which are between categories partway between the homotopy and derived categories, and Keller (d’après Lefèvre), who gives an equivalence between the derived category of \(A\) and the ‘coderived’ category of the dual coalgebra to \(A^!\). While I will largely stick to the classical setting, I will try to indicate when results hold more generally.

To any dimer model on a closed surface, one can associate a Jacobian algebra, which, by work of Broomhead, is \(3\)‐Calabi–Yau if the dimer model is consistent. A modification of the construction associates a frozen Jacobian algebra to a dimer model on a surface with boundary. In this context it is reasonable to ask when this algebra is Calabi–Yau ‘away from the boundary’, in a sense I will make precise with the definition of an internally Calabi–Yau algebra. Such algebras play an important role in the categorification programme for cluster algebras, and the main goal of the talk will be to explain this connection.

<p class="talk_description">
Cluster categories, which are \(2\)‐Calabi–Yau triangulated categories containing cluster‐tilting objects, have played a significant role in understanding the combinatorics of cluster algebras without frozen variables. When frozen variables do occur, an analogous categorical model may be provided by a Frobenius category whose stable category is \(2\)‐Calabi–Yau, although such a categorification is only known in a few cases. It is observed by Keller–Reiten that the endomorphism algebra of a cluster‐tilting object in such a category has a certain relative, or internal, Calabi–Yau symmetry. In this talk, I will explain how to go in the opposite direction; given an algebra \(A\) with a suitable level of Calabi–Yau symmetry, I will explain how to construct a Frobenius category admitting a cluster‐tilting object with endomorphism algebra \(A\).

Cluster categories, which are \(2\)‐Calabi–Yau triangulated categories containing cluster‐tilting objects, have played a significant role in understanding the combinatorics of cluster algebras without frozen variables. However, when frozen variables do appear, analogous categorical models are only known in a few cases. In this talk, I will introduce internally \(3\)‐Calabi–Yau algebras, and explain how such an algebra \(A\) can determine a Frobenius category admitting a cluster‐tilting object with endomorphism algebra \(A\).

A dimer model, which is a bipartite graph on a closed orientable surface, gives rise to a Jacobian algebra. Under consistency conditions on the dimer model, this algebra satisfies a very strong symmetry condition; it is \(3\)‐Calabi–Yau. However, the consistency condition forces the surface to be a torus. This can be avoided by allowing surfaces with boundary, on which dimer models give rise to frozen Jacobian algebras. We define a suitable modification of the \(3\)‐Calabi–Yau property for these algebras, and explain some interesting cluster‐theoretic results that follow from it.

<i>Non‐commutative geometry and quivers</i> (Postgraduate Seminar Series, Bath)

A standard approach in geometry is to study a space by instead studying the ring of functions on it, replacing geometric problems by algebraic ones. These rings of functions are always commutative (meaning \(fg=gf\) for any two functions \(f\) and \(g\)) but it is sometimes helpful to consider non‐commutative rings as if they were rings of functions on some ‘non‐commutative space’. I will explain some applications of this point of view to resolutions of singularities. This lofty ambition will mainly serve as a pretext for introducing a few more straightforward geometric and algebraic constructions (modules, quivers and simple GIT quotients) to non‐experts.

Auslander’s Theorem states that the endomorphism ring of \(S\), as a module over the \(G\)‐invariant subring \(R\), is isomorphic to the twisted group ring \(S*G\). Using this isomorphism, we can set up one‐to‐one correspondences between the indecomposable summands of \(S\) as an \(R\)‐module, the indecomposable projective modules of the endomorphism algebra, the indecomposable projective modules of \(S*G\), and the irreducible \(K\)‐representations of \(G\).

The viewpoint taken in <i>Cluster algebras I: Foundations</i>, defining the cluster algebra via an exchange pattern on the universal cover of the exchange graph, will also be dicussed.

<i>The fundamental group and triangulations</i> (Postgraduate Seminar Series, Bath)
<p class="talk_description">
The fundamental group is an important homotopy invariant of topological spaces, essentially describing the ways in which loops can be mapped into them. This talk will (loosely) explain the definition of the fundamental group and why it is a group, and then explain how to calculate it using triangulations, with some examples from \(3\)‐manifold topology.

<i>Cluster structures on homogeneous coordinate rings of Grassmannians</i> (6‐Month Viva, Bath)
<p class="talk_description">
This talk will describe a cluster algebra structure on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian, following Scott’s paper <i>Grassmannians and cluster algebras</i> (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0311148">arXiv:0311148</a>).

<i>The structure theorem in tropical geometry</i> (Geometry Seminar, Bath)
<p class="talk_description">
This talk will explain how to tropicalize a complex algebraic variety to obtain a combinatorial object known as a tropical variety. I will draw some examples of tropical varieties, and explain the structure theorem, which puts restrictions on the possible objects realizable as tropical varieties.

21.02.2012:
<i>An introduction to quiver representations</i> (Postgraduate Seminar Series, Bath)
<p class="talk_description">
I will give some of the definitions and first results in the theory of quiver representations, motivated for a general mathematical audience. I will explain quivers, representations and path algebras with simple examples, and hint at the significance of simply laced Dynkin quivers.
</p>

12.01.2012:
<i>The Auslander–Reiten adjunction</i> (Topics in Geometry, Bath)
<p class="talk_description">
This talk will demonstrate how the adjunction between the Auslander–Reiten translation and its “inverse” can be constructed explicitly, via the unit and counit of the adjunction.
