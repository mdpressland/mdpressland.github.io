<h1>UCU Strikes, Winter 2013</h1>

<b>Disclaimer:</b> The following diatribe was written for my students (with  
the possibility of wider circulation in mind) to explain my reasons  
for taking part in the UCU strike action on 31st October 2013. Some of  
the numerical information may be incorrect, as newspapers are neither  
peer-reviewed or required to give full sources&mdash;I have tried to  
indicate where I am particularly concerned about incorrect  
information. This discussion describes my personal views, and makes no  
attempt to be balanced. Interested readers should seek out alternative  
points of view. It (unfortunately) does not represent the views of the  
University of Bath.</br></br>

<b>Update Nov '13:</b> Further strike action is being taken on 3rd December 2013, and I will be taking part again. Since the last strike, the university Vice-Chancellor's salary has been increased by &pound;28,000 to &pound;384,000 a year (not including non-cash benefits). For comparison, staff employed by the University at minimum wage (of which there are many) earn &pound;6.31 per hour, which works out as &pound;13,125 per year assuming they work 40 hours every week. (Note that in particular this means that the VC's pay <i>increase</i> is more than twice the annual pay of many university employees). The living wage is currently set at &pound;7.65 per hour, or &pound;15,912 a year under the same assumption of 40-hour weeks.</br></br>

<b>Update May '14:</b> The industrial action is now suspended after concessions by the University. The pay offer of 2% is poor, and does very little to correct the damage of the previous five years of cuts. However, a major concession that I am particularly pleased about is a (slightly confusing) commitment on living wage. Many of the university's lowest-paid staff will now be paid (at least close to) living wage; this is a significant result that would probably not have been achieved without strike action from staff.</br><hr></br>


On the 31st October 2013, myself and many other teaching and  
administrative staff at the University of Bath are taking part in  
nationwide industrial action, organised by the University and College  
Union (UCU). You can find the announcement from the union <a  
href="http://www.ucu.org.uk/6794">here</a>, and a letter of explanation from Bath UCU President Marie Morley <a href="http://www.bathstudent.com/asset/News/6003/Marie-Morley-Statement-13.pdf">here</a>. The purpose of this note  
is to explain my reasons for taking part in the strike, primarily for  
the 20 or so students that I would normally teach on the day, although  
it may also be relevant to other people with an interest in higher  
education in the UK.</br></br>

The most important point I wish to make is that, at least for me, this  
is not primarily a strike about pay. It's certainly about pay to some  
degree&mdash;in real terms, the average teacher or administrator at a UK  
university has seen a pay cut of 13% over the last five years. But  
personally, I'm not overly concerned about my earnings. I would teach for free  
if I didn't need to pay the bills&mdash;it's a fantastically enjoyable  
profession. As things stand, I would be able to live with a small pay  
cut if the money was to be reinvested into providing better education  
to our students.</br></br>

However, that isn't where it's going. Instead, management pay is  
skyrocketing; reports by Bath Impact suggest that this year,  
management at the University of Bath are, on average, being awarded a  
10% pay increase. (This is probably not in real terms, but even  
factoring in inflation it reveals a fairly extreme double standard).  
As a particular example, the average Vice-Chancellor now earns approximately &pound;250,000 per year; twice the salary of the Prime Minister. (Bath's own VC is among the highest paid in the country, with earnings of &pound;384,000 annually.) I feel quite strongly that this is a phenomenal waste of money. If we must charge  
students such excessive fees, the least I expect is that they are  
reinvested in providing education, rather than to grant extreme luxury to managers.</br></br>

The usual justification for these pay hikes is that they are necessary  
to retain talented people in high-ranking positions. This seems a  
somewhat flawed argument for several reasons. Firstly, I am not at all convinced that there is a great shortage of talented people willing to take up these positions, and the current pay levels should be more than sufficient to attract them. 
Further to this, the more extreme the benefits package, the more  
likely we are to end up with managers more interested in personal  
wealth than doing anything useful. Secondly, it is not clear to me  
that senior management contribute significantly in a positive way to  
teaching or research at the university. Indeed, their main role seems  
to be marketing, trying to attract more students, particularly  
international students who pay even higher fees, to further increase  
the university's income. (This wouldn't be so bad if a little more of  
the money raised ended up being invested in education). Moreover, if I  
may be allowed a moment of petulance, given that our management have  
just overseen the construction of two new, expensive, 350-seater  
lecture theatres with no proper mathematics teaching equipment (i.e. boards) in  
them, it doesn't appear that there is much talent worth retaining  
anyway.</br></br>

Increasingly, the pay structure at the university resembles that of a  
major corporation. And here lies my primary reason for supporting the  
industrial action; the attack on staff pay is just one symptom of a  
corporatisation of higher education in the UK, which should be  
resisted as forcefully as possible. University education is not a  
commodity to be traded, but a public service that should be available  
to anybody able to benefit from it. With this in mind, I  
suggest the following principle:</br></br>

    <blockquote>A university is not a business, and should be run as a  
not-for-profit organisation. (To be as precise as possible, "profit"  
does not include money spent on reasonable investment in campus  
facilities, but it does include excessive pay and bonuses for  
managers, as these are essentially "dividends for shareholders"  
anyway). If the university takes in more money than it spends, the  
surplus should either be reinvested in education and research, or  
returned directly to the students as a fee rebate.</blockquote></br>

Sadly, UK universities largely do not abide by this. Indeed, it is  
claimed by unions that the university sector in the UK now has an  
operating surplus of &pound;1bn annually (this is disputed by UCEA,  
according to whom the actual figure is closer to &pound;380m&mdash;this would  
still be a travesty). Instead of resisting the disgraceful decision by  
government to raise the fee cap from &pound;3k per year to &pound;9k per year,  
thus allowing them to essentially end all state funding of higher  
education, many university leaders, particularly those in the Russell  
Group, welcomed the change. This is hardly surprising; the reduction  
of government funding left the universities free to take on more  
undergraduate students, thus widening their profit margins, while  
investment in staff and facilities to teach the ever increasing  
number of students is severely lacking. As one example, funding  
available for graduate students, who take on a significant teaching  
load, is in decline, and the number of grad students is falling. At  
Bath, we are already struggling to find enough postgraduate tutors for  
certain courses, and the numbers will continue to fall unless the  
university uses some of its profits to compensate for withdrawal of  
government funding.</br></br>

It is extremely distressing, as somebody who is passionate about  
teaching, to see our students paying more and more for their  
education, while the standard we are able to provide is falling due to  
underinvestment. This kind of trend seems to be an inevitable  
consequence of the privatisation of public services; something  
similar has already happened to the UK rail network, and will probably  
happen to the NHS in the near future. The current outlook appears to  
me so bleak, that I would strongly recommend that any secondary school  
student looking to apply to universities (or any parent of such a  
student) looks seriously into opportunities to study outside the UK&mdash;many European countries have universities providing excellent  
education (in mathematics, often better than that in the UK) for  
extremely low fees, if any, with many courses given entirely in  
English.</br></br>

To end on a personal note, I'm often asked why I decided to pursue a  
career in academia when, with high probability, I could earn a lot  
more working in the finance industry. There are many reasons for this,  
but the one most relevant to this discussion is that by teaching students and  
doing scientific research, I'm providing some tangible benefit to our  
society. I would hate for the primary output of my time and energy to  
be a little extra cash for an already obscenely wealthy CEO. Sadly it  
seems that even academic work no longer provides an escape from  
this.</br></br>

If you made it this far, thank you for reading, and I hope this  
reassures you that my decision to take part in strike action is a  
considered one, based on moral principles rather than desire for  
wealth.</br></br>
